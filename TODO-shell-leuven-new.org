#+TITLE:     Enhancements TODOs

* Tasks

** MAYB Use ^[ instead of \e for Zsh key bindings?

** TODO [#A] Use '[[' over '[' in Bash scripts (use Bashisms)

Advantages of '[[':
- Improved functionality: You can use logical operators like '&&' and '||'
  directly within the test
- Better handling of strings: does not require escaping and quoting
- No word-splitting or filename expansion
